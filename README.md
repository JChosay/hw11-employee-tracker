# hw11-employee-tracker

A simple command-line database management system for tracking employees and their roles, titles, salaries, and departments. Complete functionality is available to add or remove any of the above categories, as well as to update managers, roles, and departments of individual employees.

Attractive opening and closing banners add a little finish to the user interface, which is otherwise entirely on the command line and mostly done through choosing list items. Sensisble categories are presented to the user, and again after each action is carried out.

When the user has finished viewing, adding, removing, and/or updating records, they may choose "quit" to exit the application.
